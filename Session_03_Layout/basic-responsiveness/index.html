                <h2>Why Choose EcoBottle?</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional single-use plastic bottles contribute millions of tons of waste to our oceans and landfills each year. By switching to
                    EcoBottle, you're helping cut down on that waste while enjoying a healthier, more convenient alternative. Our bottles are not only
                    environmentally friendly but also engineered for performance, keeping your drinks hot or cold for hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EcoBottle focuses on simplicity and accessibility. You don't need to be an eco-expert to make a difference-just refill your bottle each day.
                    Small habits like this add up to massive positive change for the environment. Plus, we've made sure our bottles are affordable and backed by
                    a lifetime warranty to give you peace of mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond functionality, EcoBottle is also about style and self-expression. With customizable sleeves and engraved options, you can make your
                    EcoBottle truly your own. It's more than a product-it's a movement to shift how we think about everyday consumption.
