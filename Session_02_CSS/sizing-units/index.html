<!-- 
Experiment with the website below, answering the following questions:

What happens when you change the font size for the html element? Why?
    the text in inner gets bigger, because it inherits the font size
    
Change the width of the inner box to 200 pixels. How is this different from 50% here?
    well because the outer is fixed at 400px, it dosnt change anything here (I might be wrong)

Change the font-size unit of the inner element from rem to em. What happens? Why?
    The text gets bigger, because 2em is relative to its parents value, which is 2em aswell

Which unit scales when resizing the browser window?
    vh, vw (Viewport units) or procentages

Why might rem be better for consistent typography across the site?
    Because it scales of the root, not what it potentially has inherited 

What would be the issue of using pixel units across the site?
    its not responsive, so if someone wants all text bigger pÃ¥ increasing the root text size, 
    it won't, because its fixed. 

When would you use pixels instead of relative units? 
    if something needs to be a specific pixel size acroos all resizings
    or in declaring borderwidth maybe, stuff like that
